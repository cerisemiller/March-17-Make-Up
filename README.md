# March-17-Make-Up

The class on March 17, 2018 went more in depth into APIs and integrating
them into our web apps. I actually really enjoyed watching this class,
especially after meeting with my tutor this week. Although I was initially
behind on the work we've done with APIs, watching the videos and redoing
activities have helped me better understand their integration into web 
pages. Additionally, I'm more comfortable with jQuery as a result.

In this class, Rich went through the steps of getting an API key, integrating
it into our code, and using ajax to call the API. Additionally, we built
features into our apps so as to pull data from the API and display it on
the page. I look forward to exploring more ways to use APIs and make our
sites more functional.
